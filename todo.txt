-[x] add CMakeLists.txt
-[x] remove Register and Free # use ODP
-[x] send headers using separate buffers
- implement delete
- add gflags and glog
- <s>change RdmaManager::AllocateBuffer to spinlock</s>
- <s>KVStore Get and KVServer buffer size is bounded</s> (have to change the
  communication method)
- For Get, the buffer is provided by the RdmaManager. That means every
  swapped-in memory is registered. This creates too many MRs.

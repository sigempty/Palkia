dialga
-[x] add CMakeLists.txt
-[x] remove Register and Free # use ODP
-[x] send headers using separate buffers
-[x] add CMakeLists.txt for apps in dialga
- For Get, the buffer is provided by the RdmaManager. That means every
  swapped-in memory is registered. This creates too many MRs.
- implement delete
- add gflags and glog
- <s>change RdmaManager::AllocateBuffer to spinlock</s>
- <s>KVStore Get and KVServer buffer size is bounded</s> (have to change the
  communication method)

palkia
- When to swap out?
	- syscall to check periodically?
	- new/malloc on failure?
	- custom memory alllocator / hook new/malloc?
	- DerefScope?
	- only maintain Remoteable objects

- double check the refcnt

- hide the type of RemotePtr

- make sure rdma-kvstore has large enough tail room for GET AckMessage
change the name from GetContext and get_ctx_ptr_ to Context and ctx_ptr_

Priority
-[x] too much LRU::Touch is called.
- write tests and do eval
